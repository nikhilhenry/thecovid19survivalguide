Intezaar..
The dream of going home.
The dream of hugging my loved ones.
The dream of a train that flies across the sky, taking me home.
That was what was playing on my mind as I kept reading about the migrant crisis and I put this artwork together.
The adult hand belongs to a migrant worker reaching out to his child who he sees as angelic, hence the angels in the background.
There is barbed wire (circumstances) which does not allow him to reach.
The train is a train of thought, and the only thought on their mind is going home, and they are desperately trying to catch the train. 
The clouds are a symbol for 'reaching cloud nine' and dreams coming true - in this case the end of the Intezaar.
