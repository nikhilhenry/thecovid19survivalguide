Since we had to draw something to represent what’s going on in the world right now, I decided to send the message “we are all in this together” as the global pandemic has affected each one of us in its own way and it’s important for us to know that we are not alone. The reason for the mask and the human figure is to symbolize Covid-19 and the globe to show that it is a worldwide problem and taking safety precautions and adhering to the rules will help the world heal come back to normal.
