The corona virus outbreak has dramatically changed our lives and affected the social,
environmental and economic sectors in India. According to an MRD report, economists have
said that there is a job loss of 40 million people in the country and as of today we have seen a
contraction of 4.5%, a historical low. <!--more-->, How has this affected the startup ecosystem?
A startup ecosystem is formed by startups in different stages and various types of
organisations in a location (city, town etc), interacting as a system. To broadly classify it: every
stakeholder in a startup would be part of its ecosystem.
As mentioned by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, India had
over 50,000 startups in 2018 with 2-3 startups being born each day! The startup ecosystem in
India has scaled to become the third in the world after USA and China. 2019 was a
breakthrough year for India as startup funding was at an all time high, raising about 14.5 billion
USD.
Although the Indian startup industry was booming, it came to a sudden halt due to the
novel coronavirus outbreak. Results from a Nasscom survey showed that 70 percent of startups
have less than 3 months of cash runway. 22% of startup companies have 3-6 months of
runway, while only 8% have a runway for 9 plus months.
COVID has mainly affected startup revenues and funding. Since Consumer demand
came to a standstill during the first lockdown, businesses had to either shut down or redesign
their business models if they wanted to survive. Out of the 250 startups surveyed, 40% of them
halted operations or closed business. Furthermore, the data revealed that 92% of the startups
were facing a revenue decline. Out of which 62% faced a decline of over 40% in revenue.
Startup funding has also plummeted. Funding in march (the month when the lockdown
was announced) showed a 50% decrease in funding from february according to Venture
Intelligence. Many prevalent venture capitalist firms such as Sequoia Capital, Accel, and
Lightspeed warned of a difficult funding environment due to the uncertain circumstances. One
argument is that this decrease is partly due to India’s new Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
policy. This states that, “Any investor of a nation that shares land borders with India will now
require government approval for making any investment in India”. However, this was only an
additional obstacle to startup funding compared to the massive dent created by the pandemic.
These statistics were the average effects of a random sample of startups in India.
Different types of startups were affected differently. For example: Travel and Transportation
startups faced the largest decline in terms of revenue as they faced the largest decline in
consumption. Business to Consumer (B2C), startups were also affected severely as most
relatively new B2C startups reached near-zero levels of revenue.
On the other hand the edtech sector was greeted with a set of bright opportunities as they saw a
14% increase in revenue. Moreover, Business to Business (B2B) companies saw mild revenue
declines and faced less drastic repercussions than expected.

When it comes to funding, agritech and fintech startups were hit the worst, but it’s not all
bad as the healthtech sector came out with better funding. While startups are looking for loans
from banks and non-banking financial institutions, and capital infusions from investors; most
startups are seeking immediate government support for aid. Whether it be supportive policies,
easing regulations, partnership opportunities, or reimbursements on immediate fixed costs.
Two thirds of startups questioned believe that the pandemic will last for at least a year.
What will happen to startups at this rate with plummeting revenues and lack of funding? Well it’s
not that grim as the market is adapting to this situation. While traditional techcentric startups are
fading, venture capitalists and consumers have shifted focus to startups operating in sectors
such as: Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG), online delivery, home entertainment etc.
Furthermore, Edtech, fintech and cybersecurity are experiencing a great increase in consumer
demand, which is reeling in investors. The government has also issued $130,000 to startups in
order to create an encrypted video conferencing solution.
Although the pandemic has negatively affected the startup ecosystem in India, it has
also unlocked a whole new genre of potential startups. Some companies are already showing
growth patterns once again through innovative ideas to overcome the pandemic situation. Soon,
we can definitely expect a positive comeback in startups emerging and growing in India.
