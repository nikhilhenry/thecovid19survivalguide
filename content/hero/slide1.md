The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented global crisis--a true test of societies, of governments, of communities and of citizens. Public emergencies like COVID-19 threaten to cost many lives and pose additional risks to the global economy, social dynamics, human rights, and overall security and stability of nations. Presently, billions of people around the world are suffering due to this crisis. COVID-19 has spread to over 200 countries, and more than 1/4th of the world's 7.8 billion people are now under lock down in their homes.

That’s why, engagement of all of us—especially young people and educators—is key to finding solutions.

Legacy School, Bengaluru has been conscious in its efforts to respond to COVID-19. From online classes to promoting student engagement on critical issues, several impactful initiatives have been carried out over the last few weeks. We also joined hands with the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), to foster youth awareness and action on COVID-19 and its impact on vulnerable groups, emerging risks and the SDGs. In April, our students and educators participated in several UNODC interactions on issues such as discrimination, misinformation, cyber-crime, gender-based violence, peace and the rule of law.

In this context, we, the students of Legacy School, Bengaluru are proud to present this blog as an effort to dispel myths and promote citizen engagement on key areas of public concern that merit our collective attention.  This initiative is in support of UNODC's “Lockdown Learners” series and the ‘Education for Justice Initiative’. Through this, we hope to shine the spotlight on issues such as gender-based violence, cyber-crime, drugs and human trafficking, corruption and misinformation that have witnessed a surge in the wake of the COVID-19 lock down, but have receded into the background. By using our skills—through artwork, videos, articles and games--we aim to create awareness, provide advocacy and hopefully even help those troubled by these.

At  Legacy School, we believe that responding to COVID-19 must include an inviolable respect for human rights, especially those of the marginalized, vulnerable and economic disadvantaged groups.
